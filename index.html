        <h1>Snake Game</h1>
        <button id="start">Start/Restart</button>

        <h2>Score <span id="score">0</span></h2>
            <!-- id of score on span tag to change the score of the game dynamically in JS -->
        <div class="grid">
            <!-- 
                Game board is to be a 10x10 grid to start. You can always come back and change
                the size.

                The cell's height and width were set before the JS code was written just so we could see them
                as they were being created in JS using the compound selector .grid div

                I know from past experiences that when you create an element in JS you can
                also add a class. I'm wondering if after the fact of generating 100 divs in JS I
                can add a class and update the stylesheet
                ** UPDATE ** the first function created in this tutorial did exactly what I was thinking.

                Will be using JS to add 100 divs.
